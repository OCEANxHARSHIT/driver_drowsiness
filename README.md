# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

This project implements a driver drowsiness detection system using Python. The system uses computer vision techniques to monitor the driver's eye aspect ratio (EAR) and triggers an alert if drowsiness is detected.

## Features

- Real-time video capture and processing.
- Detection of facial landmarks to determine the eye aspect ratio.
- Plays an alert sound when drowsiness is detected.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- `scipy`
- `imutils`
- `pygame`
- `dlib`
- `opencv-python`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install scipy imutils pygame dlib opencv-python
